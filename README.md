# IndexWatcher
A tool for notifying when valve index store page has updated, hopefully faster than the email.

All parameters are customizable via settings.

By default, the refresh interval is set at 10 minutes, to save battery it should be increased further

Restart the service if you change the interval for changes to apply immediately. Otherwhile they will get applied after current interval has completed.
